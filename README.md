# iw1x-redirect

A web page to redirect you to `iw1x://{ip}:{port}`

Used for [CYT-Bot](https://github.com/coyoteclan/CYT-Bot) to join servers from status message because discord doesn't allow `iw1x://` uri scheme.

> **Note**
> 
> The `iw1x.exe` file will only be provided here until the author provides builds again.
>
> You can build it yourself by getting the source code [here](https://github.com/raphael12333/iw1x-client).
